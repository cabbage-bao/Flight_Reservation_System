# Flight_Reservation_System

This flight reservation system is designed so that users can do basic operations with flight. The itineraries 
consist of direct flights and indirect flights. Whenever a user search for flight results, it's required to indicate whether indirect flights will be included.
Then results will be displayed sorted by total flight time.

After searching, users need to create an account before they can reserve, buy, cancel, book or do other operations.

This system is interacted with Azure database system which provides raw flight data. To run this application, you need maven to build projects.
